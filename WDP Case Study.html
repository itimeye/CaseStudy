        <div class="csWords">The Workers Defense Project website was designed to inform potential volunteers and donors about the work of the WDP, and to encourage those with the means to do so to get involved with the organization. In our research, we noticed that certain elements of the website’s design - namely its navigation and several page layouts - hinder users from exploring the site and learning more about WDP and its resources. How might we redesign these elements so that users can easily access the information they need?</div>

      <div class="csWords">Since recognizing our users, donator and volunteer, we began to question who is the volunteer, Lola Perkins, and who is the donator, William Baker. Because WDP main focus is construction community and immigrants in Texas we know that most construction workers are of hispanic descent and usually from somewhere in South America this closely matches the immigrant population of Texas and WDP offers much needed support for immigrants as well. Keeping this in mind we begin shaping William Baker.

      <div class="csWords"> He would have to be someone with the means to donate and a true connection to immigrants or WDPs passion of “green” construction projects. William Baker is a 40 year old man who is currently a Union Rep but remembers his time as run of the mill construction worker. As times have changed William Baker understands how important we build lasting buildings that also don’t take a massive toll on our environment. William Baker also remember’s what is was like when he was a regular construction worker and was getting taken advantage of by companies. He wants more people to have what he currently has stability and the ability to provide for his family. Our next user is Lola Perkins.

      <div class="csWords"> Lola is young and what she lacks in monetary funds she makes up for in enthusiasm and free time. Lola is a recent college graduate who came from a hard working family. Because of this, Lola wants to donate her time to a organization that cares about the working class. Lola’s passion for bringing people out of poverty through direct action, knowledge, and community is why WDP is a good fit for her. Since Lola Perkins and William are very different we need to have site that has a middle ground. Modern enough not to be a distraction for Lola but also easy enough to navigate and use that William Baker a busy man who isn’t as tech savvy can use it as well.

      <h2>Patterns</h2>
      <div class="csWords">Current WDP site lacks hierarchy. Making most of the content tedious to read. It definitely gives a feeling of just a block of information that users must decipher themselves. In order to give the site dimension I added a background pattern to most pages that were word heavy. This background pattern is subtle and a simple geometric shape so as not to distract users.

      <h2>Dimensions</h2>
      <div class="csWords">In order to continue highlighting important content and keep the page easy to read a box was added on top of the background. Depending on the page and how word heavy it was, titles got their own boxes and paragraphs on the same content were boxed together. This made pages easier to scan if they were longer and shorter pages seem less empty.

      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <div class="csWords">For the WDP site we used to typefaces: Calluna, Gilory, and Filson. Gilory was only for page titles and buttons. Calluna was only paragraph text and Filson filled the gap of all subtitles. I wanted to use similar typefaces for the titles this allows the user to recognize what’s important content or that there is a change in the theme of the information. I used Calluna for the body paragraphs only. I wanted something that looked like Times New Roman. I was hoping to keep the body paragraphs familiar and easy to read.

      <div class="csWords">The current WDP is very simple and to the point. Because of this there wasn’t a lot we needed to remake for navigation wise unfortunately it didn’t leave us much to work with. We decided to take what we had and make it as visually appealing and concise as possible. We found all redundant and misplaced information, annual reports, and tried to delete what few extra pages we had.

      <div class="csWords">As we split the pages to work on we made lo-fi's that allowed us to break up the elements of each page and rearrange them. Once we got the general sense of each page layout we began to add in our visual elements and continued playing around different recurring elements, the main navigation and footer, and tried to make every page as consistent as possible.
